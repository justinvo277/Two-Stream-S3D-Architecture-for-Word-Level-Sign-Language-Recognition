# Two Stream S3D Architecture for Word Level Sign Language Recognition


## Introduce

This repository accompanies the paper [Two Stream S3D Architecture for Word Level Sign Language Recognition](). The article addresses sign language recognition at the word level based on the Separable 3D CNN (S3D) model. We propose a low-cost model because we recognize the potential for future use of identification systems on handheld devices. We have conducted experiments on many different data sets and achieved the expected results.

## Dataset

We tested on three different datasets including: [Large-Scale Multimodal Turkish Signs (AUTSL)](), [Large-Scale Dataset for Word-Level American Sign Language (WLASL)](), and [LSA64](). You can download the data now from the link we provide in this repository.
