# Two Stream S3D Architecture for Word Level Sign Language Recognition


## Introduce

This repository accompanies the paper [Two Stream S3D Architecture for Word Level Sign Language Recognition](). The article addresses sign language recognition at the word level based on the Separable 3D CNN (S3D) model. We propose a low-cost model because we recognize the potential for future use of identification systems on handheld devices. We have conducted experiments on many different data sets and achieved the expected results.
